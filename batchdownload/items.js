		"description": "Inspired by the American flag, this recipe features red (the meat), white (the potatoes), and blue (the cheese) to celebrate the 4th!  An easy marinade of garlic, oregano, and olive oil infuses the steak and squash with flavor before they hit the heat.  Marinating for just a short period of time is great, but if you can, do it ahead of time since the longer the kabobs marinate, the more flavor they absorb.",
